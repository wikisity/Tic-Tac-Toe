The lines of code of this project are written in python and designed
to build the classic game tic-tac-toe. In this game, one player is X and the other player is O.
Players take turns placing their X or O. If a player gets three of their marks on the board, in
a row, column, or one of the two diagonals, they win. When the board fills up with neither player
winning, the game ends in a draw.
